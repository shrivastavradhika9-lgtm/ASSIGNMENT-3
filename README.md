# ASSIGNMENT-3
Python Functions and Math Module Tasks
Overview

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate:

*The use of functions to calculate factorials

*The use of Python’s built-in math module for mathematical calculations

Both tasks are implemented as separate Python scripts.

Task 1: Factorial Using a Function
Description

This program defines a function named factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop or recursion.

Features

Accepts a number as an argument

Calculates factorial using a function

Returns the calculated result

Prints the factorial of a sample number

Example

Input:

5


Output:

Factorial of 5 is 120

File Name
task1.py

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Description

This program takes a number from the user and performs mathematical operations using Python’s math module.

Calculations Performed

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine of the number (in radians)

Example

Input:

25


Output:

Square root: 5.0
Natural logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303

File Name
task2.py

Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries required (uses built-in math module)

How to Run the Programs

Run Task 1:

python task1.py


Run Task 2:

python task2.py
